        <h2>History of R&B</h2>
        <p>
            Rooted in the blues and jazz traditions of the early 20th century, R&B emerged as
            a distinct genre characterized by its soulful vocals and infectious rhythms.
            The 1940s and 1950s marked the birth of R&B, with artists blending elements of blues,
            jazz, and gospel to create a sound that resonated with audiences. The golden age of R&B
            saw the genre's ascent to mainstream popularity, as independent record labels and
            influential musicians propelled it into the spotlight. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s,
            R&B continued to evolve, incorporating funk, disco, and hip-hop influences.
            The contemporary era has witnessed further innovation, with R&B artists exploring new
            sonic territories and pushing the boundaries of the genre. Today, R&B remains a vibrant
            and influential force in popular music, reflecting the ongoing evolution of African-American
            musical expression.
