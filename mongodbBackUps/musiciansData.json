Withers worked as an assembly worker for various companies, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation, where he installed toilets in airplanes.\r\n\r\nWhen Withers first moved to Los Angeles to pursue his music career, he was still working at a factory. Even after he recorded his debut album, \"Just As I Am,\" which included the hit \"Ain't No Sunshine,\" he didn't immediately quit his day job. In fact, he was so skeptical about the music industry's stability that he continued to work, even bringing a briefcase to his recording sessions.\r\n\r\nThe humorous part of this story is that when \"Ain't No Sunshine\" started climbing the charts, his co-workers at the factory teased him about his music career, not believing it would last. One day, as he was working, someone from the factory loudspeaker system called him out: \"Hey Withers, you ain't no superstar.

In 1990, when lead vocalist Huang Jiaju traveled to Africa as a \"Love Ambassador\" to offer condolences, he witnessed the harsh realities of Africans suffering from poverty and hunger due to wars and famines. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he was inspired by the story of Nelson Mandela, and composed the song \"Glorious Years\" (光輝歲月) in his honor. The song was about racism and the struggle of Nelson Mandela in South Africa. The song was a huge hit, and had a fresh sound that stood out from the sea of love songs that dominated the Cantopop scene in Hong Kong. According to a later interview with the band bassist Wong Ka-Keung, Mandela was \"deeply moved\" when he heard about the song during his final days in hospital. In 1991, Beyond released another critically acclaimed song \"Amani\" from the album Hesitation (猶豫). The song was written during Beyond's trip to Tanzania. As suggested by the title, which means \"peace\" in Swahili, the song is about the plight of war-ravaged Africa and the yearning for world peace. Part of the song's lyrics were written in Swahili.

He saw this as a betrayal of the democratic principles he had admired in Napoleon. In a fit of anger, Beethoven tore the title page of his symphony, scratching out Napoleon's name so violently that he left a hole in the paper. He later renamed the symphony \"Sinfonia Eroica\" (Heroic Symphony), with a new subtitle: \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"\r\n\r\nThis incident illustrates Beethoven's passionate personality and his deep commitment to the ideals of freedom and democracy, which significantly influenced his music and his life.

While many people interpret it as a romantic song, its origins and meaning are quite different and rather intriguing.\r\n\r\nSting wrote \"Every Breath You Take\" during a difficult period in his life. He was going through a tumultuous breakup with his first wife, Frances Tomelty. At the same time, he was beginning a new relationship with Trudie Styler, who was Frances' best friend and their neighbor. This complicated situation inspired the song's lyrics.\r\n\r\nContrary to its popular perception as a love song, \"Every Breath You Take\" is actually about obsession and surveillance. The lyrics convey a sense of possessiveness and control, which Sting has openly discussed in interviews. He has referred to it as a \"nasty little song\" and mentioned how surprised he is that many people don't realize its darker undertones.\r\n\r\nThe song was written in a very short period of time. Sting reportedly composed it in just half an hour while staying at Ian Fleming's GoldenEye estate in Jamaica. Despite its quick creation, the song went on to become one of The Police's biggest hits.\r\n\r\nWhat's even more fascinating is how the song's meaning was misunderstood. It became a popular choice for weddings and romantic occasions, much to Sting's amusement and sometimes discomfort. He once remarked, \"I think the ambiguity is something that I admire in the song. It's a little disturbing, but it's great that people can find their own meanings in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every Breath You Take\" won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1984 and remains one of the most played songs on radio. This story highlights the complex emotions behind one of rock music's most iconic tracks and offers a glimpse into Sting's creative process during a challenging time in his life.","processVideoUri":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Veo2OY5j6_M","songs":[{"$oid":"6667f27110e6f40607da7ede"}],"__v":1},{"_id":{"$oid":"6667ee1110e6f40607da7ebc"},"name":"Tori Kelly","imageUri":"https://cdn.movieguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/torikelly.jpg","anecdote":"Before becoming a successful singer-songwriter, Tori Kelly auditioned for the popular TV show \"American Idol\" during its ninth season in 2010.

She began posting videos of her singing and performing on YouTube, where she quickly gained a loyal following. Her covers and original songs showcased her vocal prowess and songwriting skills, helping her build a dedicated fanbase.\r\n\r\nHer perseverance paid off when she independently released her first EP, \"Handmade Songs by Tori Kelly,\" in 2012, which she wrote, produced, and recorded herself. The EP's success led to her being signed by Capitol Records and working with renowned producer Max Martin on her debut album, \"Unbreakable Smile,\" which was released in 2015.\r\n\r\nTori Kelly's story is a testament to her resilience and determination.
