            <h3>Anecdote</h3>
            <p>As the founding father of Czech music, Smetana was fervently nationalistic and sought to create music that specifically represented Czech culture and traditions.<br>
            Later in life, Smetana suffered from syphilis, which led to his complete deafness. Despite this severe handicap, he continued to compose.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Bedřich Smetana's compositional process began with drawing inspiration from Czech nationalism, personal life, and nature.<br>
            He developed these ideas by expanding melodies and exploring harmonies, aligning them with the narrative intent of his pieces.<br>
            After crafting and assigning parts for orchestration, he meticulously revised his works, considering practical performance aspects.<br>
            Finally, Smetana collaborated with other artists for operatic works and prepared his compositions for publication, maintaining his creative output even after becoming deaf.</p>

            <h3>Anecdote</h3>
            <p>Scott Joplin, renowned as the "King of Ragtime," revolutionized American music with his composition "Maple Leaf Rag," achieving unprecedented success.<br>
            Despite his fame in ragtime, Joplin aspired for recognition in classical music, most notably with his opera "Treemonisha," which went largely unappreciated during his lifetime.<br>
            Faced with personal tragedies and battling health issues, Joplin persisted in his musical endeavors but sadly died at 49, not living to see the resurgence and celebration of his work in the later 20th century.<br>
            His meticulous composition style and dedication have left a lasting impact on both ragtime and American music history.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Scott Joplin's compositional process was marked by a meticulous approach that blended classical music principles with innovative ragtime rhythms.<br>
            He focused on creating intricate melodies and syncopated beats, insisting that his pieces be played exactly as written to maintain their integrity.<br>
            His works typically followed a structured march form with multiple sections, each carefully crafted for harmonic and thematic consistency.<br>
            Joplin's commitment to detail and precision in both composition and publication helped elevate ragtime from a popular entertainment genre to a respected art form.</p>
