        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The nylon-string guitar, also called the classical guitar, evolved from 
            the lute, a popular stringed instrument during the Rennaisance period in Europe. 
            The lute had between six and thirteen courses of doubled nylon strings.
            As luthier technology improved, the need to double up strings to produce
            resonant sounds was no longer, and what we know as the classical guitar 
            emerged. It was smaller than the lute, had a different shape, had six 
            distinct nylon strings, and could more easily be played with the fingers
            rather than a plectrum. This new classical guitar lent itself well to fast and 
            intricate playing, so it became very popular in Spanish music, especially
            flamenco. In the 19th century, the classical guitar gained popularity and
            classical musicians and composers began to make use of it. Classical music's
            popularity helped the nylon string guitar become popular, and today 
            the classical guitar is most commonly used in classical, jazz, and latin music.
